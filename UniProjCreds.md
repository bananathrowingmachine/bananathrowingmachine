My University Projects Credits Record:
=
Since I have redacted every university project and all the other authors of said uni projects to keep this account anonymous, this should help group together who I worked with as there are some repeats, as well as give them the credit they deserve. 

__C++ Fully Functional GUI Apps:__

These are my most recently coded group projects, where I was in a team of 5 total people, same group of people for both projects. I tended to do more of the backend functionality in both, but my code is scattered throughout, as well as my ideas on how to design the projects.
For the educational app in particular, I helped a lot with refactoring, and reorganizing how the model and view communicated, although we all contributed rather evenly in both projects. Both of these projects were for the same class as well, which had us work in C++.

__C# Client HTML GUIS:__

These came before, where it was a team of 2 total, same partner for both. The snake game was us 2 for the entire time, whereas the spreadsheet before it was mostly me with us teaming up together to build the GUI (more explained in that repo). Again I tended to be more backend but I helped contribute all over,
although in my honest opinion the person I worked with for these would take hours out of her day to bugfix and change GUI stuff that I didn't ask or expect her to do which means that I do feel as if I undercontributed. She disagrees however, and I still definitely did a lot of work in the backend so I probably was fine.
Both of these projects were for the same class as well, which had us work in C#.

__Java Simple Text Generator:__

This will be my oldest project that was of any note. It was to create a simplistic (and fast) text generator, and in fact there was a class leaderboard where each pair was to compete for the fastest time. Out of I think 100-200 groups, me and my partner for this project were in 7th place,
and even then 2 of the groups ahead of us were actually TA's that knew what they were doing. This partner I worked with for this program is different from all the rest, and overall we had a pretty even split of desinging and writing code. 
This program is different from the rest in that it does not have GUI functionality and instead uses command line arguments.
