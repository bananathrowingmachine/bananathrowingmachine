Welcome to my github account! 
=
You have either found me from anything I've done on public repos, through links on my other online presences, or are a employer who was linked to this account on my resume. 

Due to this being linked to my online precese somewhat, I have (hopefully) fully anonimzed everything public, including needing to copy the code from private repos with sensitive info in the commit history to public facing repos. 

About Me:
=
My name is Zachary. I currently live in Utah, but I grew up in Oregon.

I do things, coding software is one I do quite often. Gaming, mountain biking, skiing, and travelling are others but aren't relevant to this repo. 

Currently a student studying software engineering.

Should be quite a few random things running around that I worked on for anyone here to look at, school projects, personal stuff, activity on some oss (maybe). Will definitely increase as time goes on so check back later if you wanna stalk me or whatever.  

Coding Related Things:
=
Currently I'm most familiar with C++, Python, C#, Java, and Shell however that list is bound to expand as time goes on. I've also dabbled in JSON, HTML, Docker, Qt, and probably a few other things I can't remember when I wrote this.

I definitely prefer working and am better at back-end stuff, however I do have experience with GUI's and can work with them. A lot of the school projects I'm planning on uploading soon (from when I write this) should have GUI aspects.

I also use Ubuntu as my daily driver, so I have some marginal experience in using Linux.

Any public facing university project repos will have the prefix "UniProj-", and I'll do my best to describe what the assignment was in the README.md, and it should have a link to a PDF in the repo will all the details.

Probable future coding projects include:
=
Anonimizing and moving a bunch of school projects to public repos on this account.

Working on a "games" app in C++ that will run at least [Super-Tic-Tac-Toe](https://www.supertictactoe.net/) as well as [Knucklebones](https://knucklebones.io/en/how-to-play), but more games will probably be added later. Good chance I add internet connectivity to it.

Fixing some Linux OSS software that doesn't work for me, right now I can think of [Piper](https://github.com/libratbag/piper), a way to configure gaming mice on Linux and [Komorebi-Fork](https://github.com/Komorebi-Fork/komorebi), a way to get animated wallpapers on Linux.

Definitely more to come later.

And that should be about it for now! Thanks for taking a look!
