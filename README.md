Welcome to my github account! 
=
This is where I dump a bunch of computer code. Some of it is pretty neat I think. For my full list of projects click [here](https://github.com/bananathrowingmachine?tab=repositories).

This account will have a mix of personal and university projects attached to it. Since I want to keep my online idenitity hidden, all university projects have been anonymized, however the majority of them were group projects,
so click [here](https://github.com/bananathrowingmachine/bananathrowingmachine/blob/main/UniProjCreds.md) to view a run down of which projects were with the same group of people as well as what they contributed as I still want to give them credit for their work.

About Me:
=
My name is Zachary. I currently live in Utah, but I grew up in Oregon.

Currently a student studying software engineering. I also play video games, mountain bike, ski, travel, among other things.

Coding Related Things:
=
Currently I'm most familiar with C++, Python, C#, Java, and Shell however that list is bound to expand as time goes on. I've also dabbled in JSON, HTML, Docker, QT, and probably a few other things I can't remember when I wrote this.

I definitely prefer working and am better at back-end stuff, however I do have experience with GUI's and can work with them. A lot of the school projects I'm planning on uploading soon (from when I write this) should have GUI aspects.

I also use Ubuntu as my daily driver, so I have some marginal experience in using Linux.

Any public facing university project repos will have the prefix "UniProj-", and I'll do my best to describe what the assignment was in the README.md, and it should have a link to a PDF in the repo will all the details.

Probable future coding projects include:
=
Working on a "games" app in C++ that will run at least [Super-Tic-Tac-Toe](https://www.supertictactoe.net/) as well as [Knucklebones](https://knucklebones.io/en/how-to-play), but more games will probably be added later. Good chance I add internet connectivity to it.

Fixing some Linux OSS software that doesn't work for me, right now I can think of [Piper](https://github.com/libratbag/piper), a way to configure gaming mice on Linux and [Komorebi-Fork](https://github.com/Komorebi-Fork/komorebi), a way to get animated wallpapers on Linux.

Definitely more to come later.
