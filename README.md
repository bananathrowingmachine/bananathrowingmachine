Hello!

I code stuff and I dump it here. Some of it is pretty neat. 

Currently a university student studying computer science. The public stuff currently is mostly just school projects (those repos have the prefix "UniProj-"), which I copied from the actual repos, anonymized everything as this account is linked to my fully online accounts and I don't feel like getting doxxed, and then pasted here. Credits to others I worked with that I anonymized can be found [here](https://github.com/bananathrowingmachine/bananathrowingmachine/blob/main/UniProjCreds.md).
